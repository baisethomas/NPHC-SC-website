            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC) was founded on May 10, 1930, at Howard University in Washington, DC, to foster cooperative action among its members. The chartering organizations were Alpha Kappa Alpha, Delta Sigma Theta, Zeta Phi Beta, Kappa Alpha Psi, and Omega Psi Phi. They were soon joined by Alpha Phi Alpha and Phi Beta Sigma in 1931, Sigma Gamma Rho in 1937, and Iota Phi Theta in 1997, completing the Divine Nine.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              The Solano County chapter was chartered to bring this powerful legacy to our local community. Since our inception, we have worked tirelessly to unite these historically Black Greek-letter organizations in the area, creating a formidable force for positive change, community empowerment, and cultural enrichment throughout Solano County.

              The purpose of the NPHC of Solano County is to foster cooperative actions of its members in dealing with matters of mutual concern. We promote the well-being of our affiliate fraternities and sororities, facilitate their development, and provide leadership training for our constituents.

                    <p>Each of the nine NPHC organizations evolved during a period when African Americans were being denied essential rights and privileges. Racial isolation and social barriers created a need for African Americans to align themselves with others sharing common goals and ideals.</p>
                    <p>These Greek-lettered organizations became a haven and an outlet to foster brotherhood and sisterhood in the pursuit of social change. Today, in Solano County and across the nation, that need remains. The primary purpose of our member organizations is community awareness and action through educational, economic, and cultural service activities.</p>

                     <p>Here in Solano County, NPHC promotes this lifelong interaction through forums, meetings, and cooperative programming, ensuring a lasting impact on our community.</p>
